# google-play


## Motivation

Yes, my friends. These are completely untested go bindings for the google-play API.
Why would anyone do that you ask?
Reasons.
No honestly I just wanted some stable bindings I could use for my new pet-peeve language go.

## Installation

It's 5 am dude, I am going to sleep now lol.

## Credits

Thanks to my dude [https://github.com/NoMore201/googleplay-api](googleplay-api) assembling this code was a matter of
1 day (full of cursing etc.)
Thanks for your efforts
